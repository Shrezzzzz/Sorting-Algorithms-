# Sorting-Algorithms
Sorting algorithms that do not rely on comparisons can achieve linear time complexity. 
Counting Sort sorts integers by counting occurrences, making it efficient for small ranges. 
Radix Sort processes numbers digit by digit using a stable sorting method like Counting Sort. 
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm improves string searching by preprocessing patterns to avoid redundant comparisons. 
The Eight Queens Problem, a classic backtracking problem, finds valid placements of eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. 
These algorithms highlight various computational techniques essential in computer science.
